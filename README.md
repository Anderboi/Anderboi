- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrei Upalauneu

For a long time I was an architect, but I always wanted to code.
Now I decided to change my profession and become a front-end developer.

My stack:
- HTML
- CSS (Sass)
- JavaScript
- React / Redux
- Figma
- Git

Also, at the same time I study Vue and Flutter (dart).
